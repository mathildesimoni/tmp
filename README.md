## Features

This application is designed to compute the **eigenvalues** of a square matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$. The eigenvalue problem is mathematically formulated as:

$$
A \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}
$$

where:
- $A$ is a square matrix
- $\mathbf{v}$ (non-zero) is the **eigenvector**
- $\lambda$ is the **eigenvalue** associated with $\mathbf{v}$
