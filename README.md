## Features

This application is designed to compute the **eigenvalues** of a square matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$. The eigenvalue problem is mathematically formulated as:

$$
A \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v}
$$

where:
- $A$ is a square matrix
- $\mathbf{v}$ (non-zero) is the **eigenvector**
- $\lambda$ is the **eigenvalue** associated with $\mathbf{v}$

## Libraries & Requirements

The librairies used in this application are *Eigen*, *GoogleTest* and *yaml-cpp*. They are all part of the repository as submodules.

The requirements to run this application are as follows:

- CMake: Minimum required version: 3.5.0
- C++ Compiler: Support for C++20 standard
- Doxygen (if documentation needs to be generated again) as well as the *graphviz* library for generating UML class diagrams in the documentation.
- Git: for cloning and updating submodules.
